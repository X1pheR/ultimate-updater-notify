# Changelog

## 0.5.1 - 2026-10-07

- Extends scheduled checks to configured Ultimate Updater External SSH targets without switching Proxmox guests away from the read-only `initial-inventory` lifecycle boundary.
- Reuses upstream `target-inventory.sh`, `external-selection.sh`, and `external-apt.sh check` rather than adding a second SSH/package collector.
- Bounds each External target check to 90 seconds and fails the scheduled run closed on External collection errors.
- Expands compatibility fingerprinting to the External inventory, selection, and read-only check interfaces.
- Preserves central and target-local External filters and keeps APT metadata refresh/package installation outside scheduled checks.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-10-07

- Renames the product and installed namespace to `ultimate-updater-notify`, matching the upstream Ultimate Updater product name.
- Migrates the legacy `/etc`, `/var/lib`, libexec, and systemd names without discarding operator configuration, ntfy credentials, or notifier state.
- Explicitly accepts Ultimate Updater 5.1.3 after review of its delegated `initial-inventory` and structured status-model interfaces.
- Keeps the fail-closed safety fingerprint guard and `status.json` schema version 1 boundary.
- Verifies that Ultimate Updater 5.1.3 External targets flow through the native status rendering used for ntfy notifications.
- Renames environment overrides from `PUUN_*` to `UUN_*`.


This file records user-visible changes to Proxmox Ultimate Updater Notify.

## Unreleased

## 0.4.1 - 2026-09-20

- Explicitly accepts Ultimate Updater 5.1.2 after review of its delegated read-only initial-inventory/status interfaces.
- Scheduled checks now require structured status schema_version 1 and fail closed before rendering or success heartbeat when the schema changes.
- Keeps the safety-critical upstream source fingerprint guard intact; deployment owners must explicitly accept the reviewed 5.1.2 fingerprint rather than clearing compatibility state blindly.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-09-11

- Automatic checks now delegate collection to Ultimate Updater 5.1's read-only `initial-inventory` status interface instead of maintaining a parallel APT/SSH/QGA collector.
- ntfy update messages now forward Ultimate Updater's native status rendering, including disjoint security/normal counts, total updates, and reboot-required targets.
- Fixed Proxmox host reboot detection when a newer selected PVE kernel is installed without Debian's `reboot-required` marker.
- Removed companion-owned package-list truncation and the duplicate package-count/reboot classification paths that could drift from Ultimate Updater.
- Selected targets reported by Ultimate Updater as `Not checked` now remain a failed scheduled check instead of being silently treated as healthy.
- Compatibility health now requires Ultimate Updater 5.1 and pins the accepted safety-critical upstream source fingerprint after first successful v0.4 compatibility validation; later source drift fails closed until a new notifier release accepts it.

## 0.3.2 - 2026-08-23

- Fixed manual-run notifications failing when Ultimate Updater produced logs larger than ntfy's default 4 KiB message limit.
- Manual-run notifications now send compact target/error summaries and all ntfy message bodies are bounded to 3500 bytes.
- Fixed large manual logs intermittently triggering `Broken pipe` under Bash `pipefail` during run-marker detection.
- Added public OpenSSF Scorecard reporting and protected-branch repository controls.
- Release archives now publish signed GitHub/Sigstore provenance alongside `SHA256SUMS`.
- Added explicit contribution and private vulnerability-reporting routes.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-08-18

- Improved ntfy update-notification formatting for mobile-friendly Markdown summaries, security markers and reboot-required callouts.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-08-18

- Added optional Gatus external-endpoint heartbeat support for scheduled-check dead-man monitoring.
- Extended behavior and safety validation around heartbeat delivery and failure handling.

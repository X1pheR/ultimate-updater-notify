`ultimate-updater-notify` is a community-maintained notification companion for [Ultimate Updater](https://github.com/BassT23/Proxmox). It adds safe scheduled update checks, deduplicated ntfy notifications, manual-run completion notifications, upstream compatibility health checks, and an optional Gatus dead-man heartbeat.

**It never installs package updates automatically and never changes guest power state during automatic checks.** Actual updates remain operator-triggered through Ultimate Updater.

This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or maintained by the Ultimate Updater project.

## What it adds

- Scheduled update checks at 07:00 and 19:00 through systemd, delegated to Ultimate Updater 5.1.3's read-only `initial-inventory` interface for Proxmox hosts/guests plus its native read-only External check path for configured SSH targets.
- ntfy notifications when updates appear, change, clear, fail, or recover.
- ntfy update messages that forward Ultimate Updater's native status rendering, including security/normal splits, totals, and reboot-required targets.
- Notifications for completed operator-triggered Ultimate Updater runs.
- Compatibility checks that fail closed when the upstream integration boundary changes unexpectedly.
- Safe takeover and uninstall restoration of matching upstream automatic-check cron entries.
- Optional Gatus heartbeat delivery so a silent or disabled scheduled checker can be detected independently.
- Bounded command, HTTP, and service runtimes.

## Safety model

Automatic checks:

- invoke Ultimate Updater 5.1.3's `check-updates.sh` only with `UU_JOB_SOURCE=initial-inventory` and deferred upstream notifications for Proxmox hosts/guests;
- then invoke only Ultimate Updater's own bounded `external-apt.sh check <target>` path for centrally selected External SSH targets, preserving upstream inventory, filtering, SSH and status-model behavior;
- consume Ultimate Updater's structured `status.json` and native `STATUS_MODEL_RENDER_NOTIFICATION` output instead of reimplementing package counts or reboot detection;
- never invoke the normal upstream `update -check` path;
- never install package updates;
- never start, stop, resume, suspend, or reboot LXC/VM guests; stopped or paused selected targets remain `Not checked` issues;
- fail closed when the accepted upstream safety-critical source boundary changes.

See [Safety and compatibility](docs/safety-and-compatibility.md) for the complete boundary, supported targets, compatibility guard, cron lifecycle, and runtime limits.

## Requirements

- Proxmox VE with Ultimate Updater **5.1.3** installed under `/etc/ultimate-updater`;
- Bash, `curl`, GNU `timeout`, `sha256sum`, and `python3`;
- an ntfy topic and access token;
- any guest-access prerequisites already required by Ultimate Updater for the targets it checks.

The current safety-critical compatibility baseline is exact Ultimate Updater 5.1.3. See [Safety and compatibility](docs/safety-and-compatibility.md) for details.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/X1pheR/ultimate-updater-notify.git
cd ultimate-updater-notify
sudo bash install.sh
```

Configure ntfy in:

```text
/etc/ultimate-updater-notify/config
```

Create the root-only token file:

```bash
sudo install -d -m 0750 /etc/ultimate-updater-notify
sudo install -m 0600 /dev/null /etc/ultimate-updater-notify/ntfy-token
sudoedit /etc/ultimate-updater-notify/ntfy-token
```

Then verify the integration and run one non-installing check:

```bash
sudo /usr/local/libexec/ultimate-updater-notify health
sudo /usr/local/libexec/ultimate-updater-notify check
```

Continue to run Ultimate Updater manually as usual when you decide to install updates.

## Documentation

- [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) — ntfy, secret files, guest-access prerequisites, and optional Gatus heartbeat.
- [Safety and compatibility](docs/safety-and-compatibility.md) — automatic-check boundary, supported targets, compatibility health, cron ownership, and runtime limits.
- [Operations](docs/operations.md) — notification behavior, verification, systemd units, manual updates, and uninstall.

## Development

Run the behavior suite with:

```bash
bash tests/run.sh
```

CI also runs Bash syntax checks, ShellCheck, the behavior suite, and systemd unit verification. Dependabot tracks GitHub Actions updates, external Actions are pinned to full commit SHAs, and OpenSSF Scorecard publishes an independent repository-security signal.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution requirements and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for user-visible release changes.

## Release model

Normal development does not publish releases. An accepted strict SemVer tag must resolve to the exact version in `VERSION` and an accepted source commit; guarded recovery may reuse an existing draft for that exact tag, but the workflow refuses to mutate an already published immutable release.

Release automation re-runs syntax, ShellCheck, behavior and systemd validation, builds the source archive from the exact accepted commit, writes `SHA256SUMS`, generates signed GitHub/Sigstore provenance for the archive, and only then publishes the GitHub Release.

## Security

No production credentials belong in this repository. Keep ntfy and Gatus tokens in root-readable token files, not in Git or command-line arguments.

Security-sensitive issues should be reported through [GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/X1pheR/ultimate-updater-notify/security/advisories/new). See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the supported-version and security boundary. Use normal GitHub Issues only for non-sensitive bugs, questions, and discussions that do not contain credentials, tokens, private hostnames, exploit details, or other sensitive environment information.
